Hi! This is a simple app to learn Morse code. Here you can find an encrypter and decrypter, training and Russian and English letters with it's codes and sounds. Also you can get snippets of using an accelerometer, Google Now, email client, transitions (when you go to another activity). For any questions write me on my email.
